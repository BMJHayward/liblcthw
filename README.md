Big library of useful stuff in C

1. See files dbh.h and minunit.h for macros used throughout this code
2. Uses the bstrlib, which is not mine. Get it here: bstring.sourceforge.net
3. Has basic data structures so you don't have to write them:
    linked lists, hashmap, DArray, binary tree
4. Bunch of different search and sort algorithms
5. Tests for everything
6. There is a basic TCP/IP client and a URL parser. These may not work, but give me something to start with

Thanks to Zed A Shaw and his 'learn code the hard way books'. Without them, I would
never have bothered to actually do all of this. zedshaw.com learncodethehardway.org
